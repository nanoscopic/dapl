<ol>
    <li><strong>Definitions</strong>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>"Collective Work"</strong>
            means a work, such as a digital archive or a software repository, in which
            the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
            contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves,
            are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective
            Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the
            purposes of this License. Software repositories are often used in order to
            allow code to be run easily and paired with other software components. It
            should be noted that this license specifically forbades running of the
            software as an portion of a service. For the purpose of this license,
            software repositories that include the work automatically as a dependency
            from other functional components shall not be considered part of this
            described exceptional "Collective Work" as doing so would incidentally encourage
            violation of this license if it were so.
            
            <p>Any such grouping of information with the Work that provides an automated mechanism
            for installing and running the code in combination with other software
            shall not be included in the notion of "Collective Work" described here.
    
        <li><strong>"Documented Open Compilation"</strong>
            means a form of the Work in binary digitial form as created from the source
            code by utilizing a software compiler. Any scripts or additional metadata needed
            to regenerate the compiled binary using industry standard tools is additionally
            provided along with the created binary form to make it "Documented".
            
            <p>Proprietary automated compilation systems such as repository systems that
            are not open source shall not be considered a part of this as they do not
            provide sufficient documentation in order to recreate the binaries they
            reproduce using industry standard tooling.
            
        <li><strong>"Derivative Work"</strong>
            means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing
            works, such as a translation, conversion into another programming language,
            wrapping the Work with additional code to create a library, extracting a
            portion of code for use in another project, or any created program, code,
            or data that uses the the Work in its creation.
            
            <p>The first exception to this is that a Collective Work as defined above
            shall not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
            
            <p>The second exception to this is that a Documented Open Compilation as defined
            above shall not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
            License.
            
            <p>No other exceptions exist for the purpose of this definition.
            
            <p>The two documented exceptional types, Collective Work and Documented Open
            Compilation, shall be considered acceptable alternate forms of the Work. Usage
            of and rights granted to the Work shall be equally granted to these specific
            alternate forms.
            
        <li><strong>"Licensor"</strong>
            means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
    
        <li><strong>"Original Author"</strong>
            means the individual or entity who created the Work.
        
        <li><strong>"Work"</strong>
            means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
    
        <li><strong>"You"</strong>
            means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
            not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work,
            or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
            under this License despite a previous violation.
    </ol>

    <li><strong>Fair Use Rights.</strong>
        Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
        arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
        of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
        
    <li><strong>License Grant.</strong>
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
        You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to exercise the rights

                    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
                    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the 
                    Collective Works;
                <li>
                    to distribute copies of or publicly display

        <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether 
        now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to 
        make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the 
        rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to 
        make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are 
        hereby reserved.

    <li><strong>Litigation Retaliation.</strong>
        If You institute litigation in any form against Licensor, then any
        licenses granted to You under this License for the Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

    <li><strong>Restrictions.</strong>
        The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
        and limited by the following restrictions:

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                <b>No Functional Use.</b> The Work may not be used in any way that causes a software service, product, or program
                to be able to function. Should removal of the work from any digital device cause any of the
                following to the service, product, or program,
                <ol type='I'>
                    <li>to fail or not function in any way
                    <li>to change in capability
                    <li>perform better or worse
                </ol>then the License and all granted rights shall be terminated. This shall
                apply whether the service, product, or program is free or paid. 
            
            <li>
                <b>License Reference.</b>
                You may distribute and publicly display the Work only under the terms
                of this License, and You
                 must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this 
                License with every copy of the Work You distribute or 
                publicly display. 
                
                <p><b>Unchanged Conditions.</b>
                You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
                 terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
                 hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all 
                notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. 
                
                <p><b>No DRM.</b>
                You may not distribute or publicly display the Work with any technological measures that control 
                access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of 
                this License Agreement.
                
            <li><b>No Commercial Use.</b>
                Redistributions may not be sold, nor may they be used in a commercial product or activity.
                You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in the License
                 in any manner that is intended for or directed toward 
                commercial advantage or monetary compensation. 
                
                <p><b>Free File Sharing.</b> The exchange of 
                the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
                 otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
                 commercial advantage or monetary compensation, provided there 
                is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the 
                exchange of copyrighted works.
                
            <li><b>No Corporate Use.</b>
                Distribution of the Work for any purpose internally within a corporation is expressly forbidden.
                This includes but is not limited to:
                <ol type='I'>
                    <li>sharing the Work for the purpose of analysis and replication of its abilities
                    <li>measuring performance of the code to optimize corporate algorithms
                    <li>comparing the Work in any way against corporate algorithms
                    <li>analysis of the Work to attempt to lay claim to methods used within

                    <li>transferring the Work to other employees for any reason
                </ol>
                
                <p>These behaviors are generally allowed in non-corporate environments. Individual
                researchers may engage in these activities and post the results of such acitivties publicly.
                If such researchers engage in said activities as directed by their employer than their
                activity and results shall remain forbidden and be considered in violation of the License.
            
                <p>It should be noted that this restriction will likely apply to most entities engaged
                in creating Collective Works. Allowance of Collective Works does not negate this restriction
                and this restriction shall remain in force.
                
                <p>Viewing any publicly posted and licensed copy of the Work through the internet for any corporate
                purpose shall be considered copying of the work by the company. While under employ of a company, any
                rights otherwise granted to an individual ( such as before their employee or during non work hours )
                shall be considered to not apply while engaged in company directed activities.
                
                <p>This section (5d) shall not apply to entities which Licensor has expressly and intentionally uploaded
                the Work to for the purpose of distribution, with the exception that activities 5dI-5dV shall remain
                restricted.
                
                <p>The prohibited moment of copying may be specifically noted to be when the transfer of the Work
                goes into system memory or storage of a system owned by the prohibited entity. Various entities
                allowing the internet itself to function, such as ISPs and the internet backbone, shall be expressly
                allowed to cache and transfer the Work, but shall remain restricted from the behaviors described in
                5dI-5dVII.
                
                <p>Review of the Work by corporate employees shall be permitted for the sole purpose of
                consideration of Original Author for employment. The behaviors described in 5dI-5dV shall remain
                restricted, as well as any other corporate purpose not primarily aimed at employment consideration.
                
            <li><b>Attribution.</b>
                If you distribute or publicly display the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices 
                for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the 
                medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
                 applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work 
                if supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform 
                Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated 
                with the Work. Such credit may be implemented in 
                any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a 
                Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other 
                comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as 
                prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

    <li><strong>Termination</strong>
        <ol type="a">

                The rights granted by the License will terminate automatically upon any breach
                by You of the terms of this License. Restrictions of the License shall
                remain in force in such event, and continued violation of the License shall be

            <li><b>Auto termination upon distribution end</b>.
                Licensor reserves the right to release the 
                Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at 
                any time. The License and the rights granted shall terminate 6 months after the moment
                when distribution by the Licensor is ceased. Such a termination shall supersede all
                other granted rights. Redistribution during the 6 months period will not extend
                the period, and redistribution after the 6 month period shall be deemed Copyright
                violation. By accepting this license, You agree to periodically check to ensure
                the Work is being distributed by Licensor so as to ensure you are aware of the
                license having terminated.
            
                <p>Distribution by Licensor shall be considered to be any open unrestricted
                sharing of the Work in a public forum, such as a download provided by the Licensor,
                or a download of the Work from a 3rd party where the Licensor is in control
                of the content and capable of removing it. Any available source for the Work where
                the Licensor is incapable of ending said distribution at will shall not be considered a
                distribution by the Licensor.
                
            <li><b>Intentional Termination.</b>
                The License may be terminated in regard to You at will by the Licensor at any time and
                for any reason allowable under law. Such a termination shall be immediate
                upon documented receipt of notice of termination to You by Licensor. The notice
                and its existence shall be considered strictly confidential.
                
                <p>No public notice of such a termination need be given by Licensor and You agree not
                to publicize such a termination if it occurs. Forbidden publication shall include
                any post to the internet, whether on the public world wide wide or through a
                private forum. Forbidden publication shall also include communication of the

            applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
            the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action 
            by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to 
            the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
            enforceable.
            
            <li><b>Only Written Signed Exceptions.</b>
            No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no 
            breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing 
            and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
